# FREE-Merging

## ðŸ”¥ News
- *2025.06*: ðŸŽ‰ Our [FREE-Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16815) is accepted by ICCV 2025.

## Introduction
This is the official implementation of our paper: [FREE-Merging: Fourier Transform for Model Merging with Lightweight Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16815). We realize cost-free model merging method with lightweight task-specific experts.

We provide the code for merging ViT models, language models, and Large Language Models. We will gradually open-source the merging code of more models in the future. At the same time, we will continue to improve our code framework.

The workflow of FREE-Merging involves two main steps. First, FR-Merging utilizes high-pass filtering to remove harmful specialized information from each model, thereby constructing a high-quality merged backbone. Second, it employs lightweight extraction of task experts, which are dynamically added during inference to mitigate the impact of task conflicts
