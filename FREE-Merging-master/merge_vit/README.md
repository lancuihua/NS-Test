# Merging Vision Models

## Merging 8 Vision Models

### Dependencies

Please follow [task_vectors](https://github.com/mlfoundations/task_vectors) and [EMR-Merging](https://github.com/harveyhuang18/EMR_Merging) to install the dependencies.

### Checkpoints

We use publicly available checkpoints from existing works. You can refer to [task_vectors](https://github.com/mlfoundations/task_vectors) and [EMR-Merging](https://github.com/harveyhuang18/EMR_Merging) to download and place the models accordingly.The Google Drive folder is: [task_vectors_checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u_Tva6x0p6oxu5Eo0ZZsf-520Cc_3MKw).

### Datasets

Please follow [Adamerging](https://github.com/EnnengYang/AdaMerging?tab=readme-ov-file#datasets) to download the datasets.

### Run

You can easily run our FR-Merging and FREE-Merging using the following commands. The default parameters can be modified in the `config` folder.

```
# For FR-Merging
python main_merging --method FR
# For FREE-Merging
python main_merging --method FREE
```

## Merging 30 Vision Models

### Checkpoints

We use publicly available checkpoints from existing works. You can refer to [EMR-Merging](https://github.com/harveyhuang18/EMR_Merging) to download and place the models accordingly. The Google Drive folder is:  [30_model_checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KZv7RHIuNGzvjaVBJ7zkUxP1tG-4bGlI?usp=sharing).

### Datasets

All the datasets for these checkpoints are open-source please follow [EMR-Merging]([EMR_Merging/merge_vit at main Â· harveyhuang18/EMR_Merging](https://github.com/harveyhuang18/EMR_Merging/tree/main/merge_vit)) to download the datasets. 

### Run

You can easily run our FR-Merging and FREE-Merging using the following commands. The default parameters can be modified in the `config` folder.

```
# For FR-Merging
python main_vits_30 --method FR
# For FREE-Merging
python main_vits_30 --method FREE
```
